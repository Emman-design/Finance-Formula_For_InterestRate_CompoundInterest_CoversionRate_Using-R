# Mathematical-Finance-Using-R
Financial math has its roots in basic finance formulas related to the time value of money. Financial instruments such as bonds, for instance, are calculated using derivatives of these basic formulas.  So, while I was taking a finance class, I wrote programs with R for some of these equations. One may also generalize the program even more complex financial problems.
